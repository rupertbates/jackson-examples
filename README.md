A test project for collecting examples of how to use the Jackson JSON library.

Current examples:

* Polymorphism - how to serialise and deserialise a class hierarchy
* Enums - how to control the json representation of enums
* How to use the @JsonRootName annotation to unwrap a nested class
* How to unwrap a nested inner class - this involves creating a static inner class for the useless wrapper class
